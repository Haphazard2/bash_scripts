The following are examples of my bash coding skills.
* add_instance.sh - A script to add a new EC2 instance, and remove the old (if an old one exists under the same DNS name).  This script automates every step except for the actual editing of the DNS entry.  Out of a sense of caution, I instead configured it to print out the replacement line entry just before opening the zone file for editing.  There are even built in wait segments while the instance comes online, and laiter while the DNS entry updates.  Like most of my scripts, I incorporated logging and idempotency for robustness.

* dse_rolling.sh - A script to manage and orchestrate cassandra instances in various clusters.  I created this script before I learned ruby, and so stored host names and attributes in hand-generated table files.  This script performs tasks like upgrade, remove instance, rolling restarts etc, all without causing any downtime.  There is a built-in feature to ensure that a restarted node is fullly functional before moving on to the next host in the ring.
